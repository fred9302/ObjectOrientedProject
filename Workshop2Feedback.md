# Workshop 2 Feedback

Interface between the network and devices.

Make network handle more stuff that simulation currently handles.

Misunderstanding that coupling between simulation and network is bad.

More coupling between network and simulation creates a better seperation and makes the program more easily understood.

If a database were to be implemented, it should probably store a device identifier, position, as well as the different metrics, so that we will be able to reconstruct the simulation conditions.

The GUI is not intuitive, since the user does not know why to input the parameters in the beginning.
